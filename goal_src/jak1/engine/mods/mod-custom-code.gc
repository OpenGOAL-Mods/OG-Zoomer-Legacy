;; What is this file for.
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

#|
 This file contains function defenitions that are pre placed in the mod base,
    so if you place custom code inside of these functions, it will exectue based on
    the name of the function, for example, if you place (set! (-> *game-info* fuel) (+ (-> *game-info* fuel) 1))
    to the function named runs-on-orb-pickup, then jaks powercell count will increase each time you collect
    an orb
